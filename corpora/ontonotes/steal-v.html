<h3>Sense Number 2: do or achieve something surreptitiously or stealthily </h3>
</font>
<p>Commentary:<font color="33066"<i> Syntax includes: NP1 STEAL NP2 NP1 STEAL AWAY/OUT PP <br>
NOTE: In this sense, STEAL usually is accompanied by a nominalized verb (verb-made-noun). Also note that the NP2 (what is stolen) cannot come into existence before the action of stealing (as opposed to things like wallets, hearts, or memories that exist even before the actual act of stealing). <br>
NOTE: The last two examples in this set specifically means "to move or carry stealthily". </i></font></p><p><u>Examples:</u><br>
