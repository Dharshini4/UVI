<h3>Sense Number 1: be inherent in or expressed by </h3>
</font>
<p>Commentary:<font color="33066"<i> Syntax Is: NP1[topic] CONSIST PP{OF/IN NP2[state]} NP1[topic] CONSIST PP{OF/IN NP2[attribute]} <br>
NOTE:(might be paraphrased as, "Basically, NP1 is (or is due to) NP2.") <br>
NOTE: the focus is on a state or attribute inherent or central to the topic. Unlike sense 2, NP2 could be considered as the key or necessary ingredient to NP1. <br>
NOTE: The key attribute or state mentioned (NP2) is adequate to summarize NP1 (although it may not be the entire content of NP1).  This is not always the case in sense 2, where if only one part is mentioned, it does not adequately summarize the whole. </i></font></p><p><u>Examples:</u><br>
The problem consisted of a torn ligament in his shoulder.<br>
Her popularity consists of an ability to make friends easily.<br>

<h3>Sense Number 2: be composed of or be made of, as parts to a whole </h3>
</font>
<p>Commentary:<font color="33066"<i> Syntax Is: NP1[topic] CONSIST PP{OF NP2[attribute[plural]]} <br>
NOTE: the topic is a whole made from the parts. Unlike sense 1, the NP2s are not the central attributes for NP1. They are just one of the many pieces that make up NP1. <br>
NOTE: If the entire list of parts is given, NP1 will be completely described, but if only a portion is given, NP1 is not completely described (ie, you couldn't say, "Basically, Internet content is material unsuitable for children." That material is only a portion of the content, not a defining characteristic.) </i></font></p><p><u>Examples:</u><br>
The exhibition consists of early drawings and several large canvases by the painter.<br>
This simple cake consists of only flour, butter, eggs and chocolate.<br>
