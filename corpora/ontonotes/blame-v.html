<font color="8B0000">
<h3>Sense Number 1: accuse; name a cause for a specific event/result </h3>
</font>
<p>Commentary:<font color="33066"<i> NP[+accuser] BLAME NP[+causer] (PP[+outcome]) NP[+accuser] BLAME NP[+outcome] PP[+causer]  <br>
NOTE: The cause/blamed is not necessarily responsible for the outcome. The accuser assigns this responsibilty (probably based on circumstance or evidence). Note that unlike in sense 2, negation will take away the cause: "I didn't blame the mess in the kitchen on John."  = John did not make the mess. </i></font></p><p><u>Examples:</u><br>
They blamed the accident on the icy road.<br>
They blamed the icy road for the accident.<br>
Mary blamed John for the mess in the kitchen.<br>

<h3>Sense Number 2: find fault with; criticize a particular feature or action </h3>
</font>
<p>Commentary:<font color="33066"<i> NP[+agent] BLAME NP[+recipient] PP[+attribute/action] <br>
NOTE: unlike sense 1, a specific cause may not be given here <br>
NOTE: Although it is often used in the negative, it is clear that the recipient possesses or shows the attribute.  Unlike in sense 1, negating the sentence does not take away the attribute: "I don't blame Sally for being mad," does not mean that she isn't mad.  She is. </i></font></p><p><u>Examples:</u><br>
The critics blamed the film for being violent.<br>
I don't blame Sally for being mad about this.<br>
Can you blame them for being suspicious?<br>
Bob often gets blamed for speaking too loudly.<br>
