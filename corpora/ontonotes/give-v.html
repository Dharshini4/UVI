If you see an indirect object or object of true phrase that is inanimate, it is more likely to be a light verb. </i></font></p><p><u>Examples:</u><br>

We gave a collective gasp at the beautiful fireworks<br>
display. (Recipient is odd)<br>
She gave a small groan at the sight. (Recipient is odd)<br>
