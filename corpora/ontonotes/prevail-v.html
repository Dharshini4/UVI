<h1>prevail-v; 3 Senses</h1>
<font color="8B0000">
<h3>Sense Number 1: win, emerge as dominant </h3>
</font>
<p>Commentary:<font color="33066"<i> Syntax Is: NP1 PREVAIL[transitive] (OVER NP2) <br>
NOTE: in this sense, NP2 may be omitted. To test this sense, try to add "over NP" to the sentence.  If it is acceptable/natural/wouldn't make you cringe if you heard it, then use this sense. EXAMPLE: okay: He has said he is confident that democracy will prevail (over other forms of government.) not okay/weird: *Sunny skies will prevail (over cloudy skies.) <br>
NOTE: if the context is too ambiguous to determine the existence of NP2, choose sense 2. </i></font></p><p><u>Examples:</u><br>
The champion prevailed, even though it was a hard fight.<br>
The heroes prevailed against the enemy.<br>
I am sure that justice and common sense will prevail in the end.<br>
And did reason prevail over emotion?<br>
