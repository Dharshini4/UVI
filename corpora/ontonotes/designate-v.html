<h1>designate-v; 2 Senses</h1>
<font color="8B0000">
<h3>Sense Number 1: give a formal name or title to </h3>
</font>
<p>Commentary:<font color="33066"<i> Syntax Includes: NP1[agent] DESIGNATE NP2[theme] (NP[attribute]) NP1[agent] DESIGNATE NP2[theme] (ADVP) <br>
NOTE: compare carefully to sense 2. This sense only refers to assigning a formal, quotable name or title. You should be able to put the name in front of the NP2 (usually separate the 2 with BE) like: 'Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard is the highway...' You can't do this with the examples in sense 2. Name or title may be a single word or a phrase that constitutes a title, but must be an actual name, not just a discriptor. </i></font></p><p><u>Examples:</u><br>
This highway has been designated Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.<br>
The process is designated by statisticians as 'the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns.'<br>
